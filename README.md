# Machine Learning Implementations
This repo contains me and my team's implementations on machine learning field of study.

## List of impementations
### Neural Network Architecture
* **LeNet-50 - on MNIST Dataset [FINISHED](https://github.com/farhanr/ml-implementations/blob/master/neural-network/lenet-50/lenet50-mnist.ipynb)** - recognizes handwriting image with 98.42% accuracy.
* **LeNet-100 - on MNIST Dataset [FINISHED](https://github.com/farhanr/ml-implementations/blob/master/neural-network/lenet-100/lenet100-mnist.ipynb)** - recognizes handwriting image with 98.89% accuracy.
* **ResNet - on Tomato Leaf Dataset [UNFINISHED]** - ..
* **ResNeXt-50 - on Tomato Leaf Dataset [FINISHED](https://github.com/farhanr/ml-implementations/blob/master/neural-network/resnext-50/resnext50-tomato_leaf.ipynb)** - determines a tomato plant disease based on its leaf image pattern with 75.25% accuracy.

### Regression Algorithm
* **Multiple Linear Regression - on CO2 Emission Dataset [FINISHED](https://github.com/farhanr/ml-implementations/blob/master/regression/multiple_linear/mll-co2.ipynb)** - finished with mean absolute error (MSE) percentage of 14.03%.
